    "category": "Retune",
    "views": 850,
    "content": "The sound of a handpan changes gradually over time, much like a human voice. Frequent use can cause 'pitch drift' where notes gradually go out of tune, and sudden temperature/humidity changes or impacts can cause 'acute pitch shift' where pitch suddenly becomes misaligned or tuning detaches. If physical damage like dents is added to this, the resonance can sound muffled and stuffy.\n\nIn such cases, regular retuning, like car maintenance, can restore the pitch and bring back the clear, smooth sound from when you first got it. We recommend a cycle of 3–6 months for frequent practice and 6–12 months for general use.\n\nWhen your instrument sounds unstable and muffled compared to when you first got it, there are three main causes:\n\n1) Pitch Drift Due to Instrument Use\n\nConcept (Precision): Long-term trend where the frequency of each tone field gradually shifts due to residual stress redistribution and micro plastic deformation caused by performance and transport.\n\nSymptoms: Notes sound slightly flat or sharp. The harmony of fundamental, octave, and fifth becomes blurred, making the sound feel dull.\n\nCharacteristics: Gradual, cumulative change. Often does not recover immediately even with environmental stabilization. Can be realigned to target ratios (F₀·2F₀·3F₀) through regular retuning.\n\n2) Acute Pitch Shift Due to External Factors (Temperature, Humidity, Impact)\n\nConcept (Precision): Noticeable tuning deviation occurring in a short time due to rapid temperature/humidity changes, drops, strong impacts, or long-distance transport stress.\n\nSymptoms: Specific notes suddenly feel jarringly wobbly or \"sandy,\" with harmonic phase misalignment causing harsh sound.\n\nCharacteristics: Acute change is typical. If temperature is the only cause, reversible recovery may occur after returning to original temperature. If impact, adhesive failure, or dents are involved, irreversible damage is more likely, so early inspection is recommended.\n\n3) Vibration Interference Due to Damage\n\nConcept: Structural damage such as dents, creases, or adhesive failure interferes with resonance.\n\nSymptoms: Metallic noise at specific notes, \"buzz\" or \"wolf tones,\" sudden sustain reduction, sound feeling blocked depending on touch intensity.\n\nAction: Arbitrary straightening or tapping can cause secondary damage and is prohibited. Immediate professional inspection recommended.\n\nTerminology\n\nPitch Drift (= Pitch Height Drift, Pitch/Tuning Drift)\n\nDefinition: Pitch change that gradually accumulates through use and time.\n\nCauses: Residual stress redistribution, micro plastic deformation, gradual boundary condition changes.\n\nAcute Pitch Shift (= Acute Tuning Offset, Acute Pitch Shift / Acute Tuning Offset)\n\nDefinition: Pitch change that suddenly occurs due to rapid temperature/humidity changes, drops, impacts, etc.\n\nCause Classification: Thermal factors → Generally reversible (recovery possible when returning to original temperature). Impact, dents, adhesive failure → High possibility of irreversibility.",

This layer is a natural defense barrier that protects the metal from rust and corrosion, and it repeatedly peels off and reforms partially depending on factors such as hand oils, moisture, temperature changes, and friction during use.\n\nFine powder or stains that come off on your hands are remnants of the oxide film formed during heat treatment, and this is not rust but a phenomenon that occurs during the natural surface stabilization process of the metal. Through this process, the surface color gradually becomes uniform, and initial scratches or heat treatment spots may become less noticeable or disappear.\n\nDepending on usage frequency, it takes 2-3 years for the surface to naturally peel off completely. However, if you find the partial peeling of the instrument surface visually uncomfortable during this process, there is also a method to artificially create a uniform appearance by shortening the time through full surface sanding (the process of grinding with fine sandpaper).",

For this, it's good to pay attention to temperature and humidity management.\n\nIf exposed to direct sunlight, the instrument's surface temperature rises rapidly, causing immediate detuning. With prolonged high-temperature exposure, the adhesive between the top and bottom plates can weaken, causing the instrument sides to separate. Leaving the instrument in a car during hot weather for extended periods is also not good for the instrument. When playing outdoors or storing, it's best to keep it in the shade.\n\nAfter playing, wipe the surface with a soft cloth to remove fingerprints, sweat, and foreign matter. When cleaning, gently wipe with body oil that is safe for human contact.

    "content": "Resonance and harmonics are core principles that determine an instrument's sound quality and timbre.\n\nResonance refers to a state where energy efficiently concentrates on a specific natural frequency (mode) among many vibrations, causing the amplitude to increase. When the timing is right, that mode resonates particularly loudly and for a long time. All resonance is vibration, but not all vibration is resonance. In handpans, when the small touch energy from fingertips is injected into the shell's natural mode, the sound spreads widely and the sustain lengthens. Even with the same striking force, richer and more stable resonance is produced, enhancing both playing feel and timbral depth.\n\nHarmonics are overtones that naturally overlap with the fundamental tone. Handpans are precisely tuned so that the fundamental F₀ resonates together with the octave 2F₀ and compound fifth 3F₀. These three frequencies combine as one to create a clear and solid single tone, and when harmonized with the stainless steel shell's resonance, the handpan's unique clear and mystical 'harmonic tone' is completed.",

    "content": "In the early days of handpans, general steel plates like DC04 were mainly used, but now stainless steel (SUS430, etc.) has become the industry standard. To use an analogy, DC04 has a sound that's clear and distinct like a rhythm instrument, while stainless steel is closer to the reverberation of a concert hall where the resonance spreads long and fills the space. Maintenance also differs. DC04 is sensitive to moisture and sweat like leather shoes, requiring more care, while stainless steel is rust-resistant like waterproof sneakers, maintaining stable surface and condition for a long time.\n\nThe important point is that this is not simply a matter of preference but an upward evolution in quality. Stainless steel, thanks to its corrosion resistance and rigidity, allows harmonic resonance (fundamental, octave, fifth) to overlap more clearly, has longer sustain, and experiences less pitch drift over use and time. As a result, with the same manufacturing quality, stainless steel instruments are evaluated as higher quality. They are advantageous not only for performances that emphasize reverberation like meditation and healing, but also for recording, ensemble playing, and long-term use. In summary, while there may be differences in usage, stainless steel has established itself as a superior material in overall acoustic quality, durability, and maintenance convenience.",

    "content": "SND Handpan forms precision hemispherical shells from stainless steel plate (SUS430, 1.2 mm) through metal spinning, then completes them in the following sequence: pressing, heat treatment (400°C, 20 min), stretching hammering, first harmonics tuning, adhesive curing, rim processing, second harmonics tuning, and inspection.\n\nEach tone field aligns the mode phases of the fundamental frequency (F₀) and two harmonics (2F₀, 3F₀) through phase alignment, so that the three frequencies synthesize into a single timbre without interference by fine-tuning tension and curved surface geometry. This is the core principle.\n\n**1) Metal Spinning (Hemispherical Shell Manufacturing)**\n\nThe metal spinning process aims to secure hemispherical shells with minimized thickness deviation and eccentricity. The SUS430 blank is fixed to a chuck and rotated while flow forming is performed through multi-pass spinning rollers. Key indicators are thickness deviation ≤ ±0.05 mm, ovality ≤ 0.3 mm, and circumferential runout ≤ 0.4 mm. Excessive local deformation may cause orange peel, but this is suppressed through roller pass division and lubrication management.\n\n**2) Sanding (Surface Preparation)**\n\nThe sanding process aims to secure uniform matte texture and remove contamination. It also prevents contamination vaporization and carbonization before heat treatment. After uniform polishing with sponge sandpaper, industrial oil and particles are removed, and the surface is finished with a lint-free cloth. Surface cleanliness is maintained at visual grade 5 or above according to AATCC grade discrimination, and residual scratch Ra target values are set. If residual oil or dust remains, heat tint spots may occur after heat treatment, so clean handling is essential at each process step.\n\n**2-1) Bottom Plate Gu Forming**\n\nBottom plate Gu forming is a process where the center is opened with a hole saw, then the Gu flare angle and curvature are formed with a die press. Gu diameter tolerance is ±0.2 mm, flare angle tolerance is ±1°, and there must be no burrs or cracks. Internal volume and port impedance determine resonance bandwidth and low-frequency response.\n\n**3) Instrument Structure Design (Scale Layout Determination)**\n\nThe instrument structure design process aims to minimize resonance interference and secure balanced mass distribution. After determining the scale (normal/mutant), optimal positions are searched using tone field magnets, and locations are marked with a marker. Minimum spacing criteria between tone fields and standardized boundary distances from the rim are established. To avoid inter-tone mutual mode coupling, an array avoiding eigenmode overlap is important.\n\n**4) Pressing (30 ton)**\n\nThe pressing process aims to provide primary shape to tone fields and set the tension baseline. A 30-ton press is used to form shallow depressions while controlling stroke, load, and dwell time. Target curvature radius, up/down dome height tolerance, and springback prediction correction are adjusted. Over-forming may cause cracks and wrinkles, while insufficient forming requires excessive hammering. Therefore, operators need real-time feedback.\n\n**5) Heat Treatment (Stress Relief/Surface Stabilization)**\n\nThe heat treatment process maintains 400°C for 20 minutes, followed by water cooling, moisture removal, and body oil surface coating. The objectives are to relieve cold-working residual stress, linearize elastic response, and stabilize the oxide film. Strain recovery is improved and residual stress is reduced, which can be estimated through acoustic response changes. If contamination remains, heat tint spots may occur, so continuous management is required from post-heat cleaning, drying, and oil coating.\n\n**6) Shell Stretching (Hammering Uniformization)**\n\nThe shell stretching process aims to uniformize shell-wide tension and set the initial tension of tone fields. Through full-surface hammering, tension patches from pressing are released and aligned to a uniform tensile state in a 360° direction. Local rebound feel becomes uniform and membrane tension is equalized. This process secures the prerequisite for phase alignment and also sculpts the three-dimensional appearance.\n\n**7) First Harmonics Tuning (Mode 1:2:3 Matching)**\n\nThe first harmonics tuning process aims to match F₀, 2F₀, and 3F₀ of each tone field to the reference frequency. Tension and curvature are fine-adjusted through internal and external hammering while simultaneous feedback is received from tuner measurement and listening. Tuning error (F₀/2F₀/3F₀) is maintained within ±1.0Hz range, mode crosstalk is minimized, and sustain Q target values are achieved. Sound quality is enhanced through numerical matching as well as auditory optimization of clarity and resonance.\n\n**8) Adhesion/Curing (Top/Bottom Plate Bonding)**\n\nThe adhesion/curing process applies high-viscosity resin, performs pressure bonding, and manages curing time according to the environment.\n\n**9) Rim Processing**\n\nRim processing aims to secure safety, aesthetics, and durability. After removing residual resin, edges are rounded with grinding and sandpaper to create a smooth tactile feel that prevents finger injury during use.\n\n**10) Second Harmonics Tuning (Drift Correction)**\n\nThe second harmonics tuning process aims to correct frequency drift occurring after adhesion and stress redistribution. All notes are re-measured, fine hammering is performed, and phase alignment is reconfirmed. Final error (F₀/2F₀/3F₀) is maintained at ±1.0Hz, mode coherence is improved, and sustain consistency is enhanced.\n\n**11) Inspection/Stabilization**\n\nInspection and stabilization are observed within 7 days after completion. Pitch stability, phase alignment maintenance, appearance defects, surface condition, rim finish, and resonance balance are checked. Shipment occurs when criteria are met.",

    "content": "Press and metal spinning are different manufacturing methods used to create shells. Press (deep drawing) method shapes the metal plate in one go by applying strong force. During this process, the applied force varies across different parts, causing some areas to become thinner and others thicker. Additionally, if the die is not perfectly aligned or the metal slides inconsistently, fine wrinkles or edge angles can form on the surface. These differences combined can result in slightly asymmetrical shell shapes or uneven distribution of internal stress.\n\nIn contrast, metal spinning gradually shapes the metal plate while rotating it, allowing the metal to stretch evenly and curves to connect smoothly. Therefore, the thickness and tension of the entire shell remain consistent, and sound transmission is uniform. Shells made this way have excellent structural balance, resulting in consistent resonance and clear harmonics.\n\nSimply put, spinning is like carefully crafting with skilled hands over time, while press is closer to stamping out a shape in one forceful action.",
